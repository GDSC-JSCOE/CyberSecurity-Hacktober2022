Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (overt and publicly available sources) to produce actionable intelligence.

OSINT is achieved by ingestion of video, image, audio, and text data from public domain data sources and analyze the ingested data to yield insights from across all data sources. The analysis is based upon machine learning and deep neural network algorithms which enable the system to learn from the data to achieve and refine recognitions of patterns, trends, and relationships.

Some of the top tools used for OSINT are :-
