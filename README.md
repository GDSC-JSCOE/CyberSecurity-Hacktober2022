> We are open for your Pull Requests and yes this is a dedicated repository for creating PR for Hacktobest 2022 🔥

The **RULES** are very simple! (PS: You have to read even if boring 😂)
1. There are basic cyber security oriented questions listed in another file called "flag.md" 
2.  You have to go through those questions and try to answer maximum of them. 
3. **The first PR with correct answer and the PR name as HACKTOBERFEST will be accpeted (FIRST COME FIRST SERVE)**! Kindly send seperate PR for each seperate answer. It simply means- even if write one corrent answer or 4 correct answers at once - IT WILL BE COUNTED AS ONE SINGLE PR (So be smart and create PR for each right answer) 
4. Once your PR is approved (with label of "Hacktoberfest-Accepted") your name will be automatically listed in the shiny super "**contributors**"list 😎
